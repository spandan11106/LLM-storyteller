# LLM Storyteller üêâ

A graphical, AI-powered Dungeon Master and interactive story engine. This application uses the Groq LLM API to generate dynamic, narrative-driven adventures. It features an advanced memory system to ensure story coherence and a dynamic social AI that allows NPCs to react to the player's behavior.

## Features

* **Graphical User Interface**: A clean, modern UI built with `customtkinter` that includes a chat window and a dynamic sidebar for character and NPC status.
* **Dynamic Storytelling**: Powered by the Groq LLM API (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) to generate creative and responsive narratives.
* **Advanced Three-Tier Memory**:
    * **L1 (Turn Memory)**: Remembers the most recent turns for immediate context.
    * **L2 (Scene Memory)**: Intelligently detects scene changes and creates summaries for medium-term recall.
    * **L3 (Core Memory)**: Maintains a constantly updated summary of the entire story, ensuring the AI never forgets key events.
* **Dynamic Social AI**: NPCs have emotional states and relationship scores that change based on the player's tone. The system dynamically detects new NPCs introduced in the story and begins tracking them.
* **Simple Gameplay Mechanics**: A narrative-driven system for player state ('Healthy' or 'Wounded') and a linear plot-point quest system.
