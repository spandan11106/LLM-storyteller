The Ultimate Memory Challenge for AI
====================================

Hey there! This demo is designed to blow minds and prove beyond any doubt 
that our AI storyteller has REAL long-term memory. Here's how we're going 
to absolutely convince everyone:

1. We'll casually drop some very specific details into our story
2. Then we'll chat about tons of completely unrelated stuff to "bury" those details  
3. Much later, we'll ask our AI to remember those exact details from way back
4. Watch in amazement as it recalls things from dozens of conversations ago!

This isn't some parlor trick - either the AI genuinely remembers or it doesn't.
No amount of clever programming can fake this kind of long-term recall!
