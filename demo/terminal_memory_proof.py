Memory Magic in the Terminal! 
============================

A simple, friendly terminal demo that'll absolutely convince anyone
our AI has real long-term memory. Perfect for judges who want to
see the proof without any fancy graphics!

Here's what we're going to do:
1. Casually slip some secret info into our conversation
2. Chat about tons of random stuff to bury those secrets  
3. See if our AI can dig up those exact details from way back

This is the real deal - no smoke and mirrors, just pure memory power!
